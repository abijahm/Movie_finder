This App accepts a combination of actor names and querys Tmdb REST api for movies they are credited

## Goal

The goal of this app was to familiarise myself with the model-view-controller architectural pattern using vanilla javascript

## Running the app

The app uses parceljs for bundling and transpiling ES6

```sh

#clone the repository

git pull https://github.com/abijahm/Movie_finder.git


cd Movie_finder/

yarn install

# run dev mode - uses parceljs bundler
yarn dev
